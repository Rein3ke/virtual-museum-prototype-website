# Virtual museum prototype
This project is a museum platform built with Unity and deployed for WebGL. Using this repository, it is possible to use GitHub Pages to host this application (for testing purposes). There are already some features in the application, such as a first-person view (WASD control), as well as a rotational view in which you can get an overview of the museum. All exhibits are models that are packaged from an AssetBundle and loaded at runtime.

The entire concept was developed together with the [Berlin Museum of Technology](https://technikmuseum.berlin/). The application itself was implemented at the [Berlin University of Applied Sciences](https://www.htw-berlin.de/).
